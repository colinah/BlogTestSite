This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

o	Git commit : actually commits the git repository if you have added one already but it is still on your machine
o	Git commit –m “message”: the –m is more message you can add messages to the commits. If you hit enter without the -m  you need to hit esc then type  :wq then enter
o	Git push: will update your commits to online repository
o	Git pull:will pull what is online into that directory
o	Git add –A: adds everything in your directory to commit.
o	Git branch <name> : creates a new branch
o	Git checkout <name> : switches to named branch
o	Git merge <name> : Important that you are on the branch you want to be the final merge so if you are merging a working branch to the master branch first checkout into the master branch then merge the working branch into the master branch. You merge from named branch into current branch.
o	Git branch –D <name> deletes a branch
o	Git push origin <name> to push things onto a named branch
o	git remote set-url origin <url> change the set origin if you are submitting to the wrong repository or didn’t set up correctly initially
